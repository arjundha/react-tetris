# Project Overview

This project was created by following the tutorial here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGOaCxX8HIU&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org

If you're interested in building the project from the ground up, it is a fun tutorial that makes you brush up on components, hooks, and general React goodness.

The eslint rules and prettier rules were expanded from the Airbnb Style Guide, with some modifications from myself.

## Note to Self:

The project is still in progress, I am adding functionality to store tetriminos, and slam tetriminos as far down as they can go. Scores and more will be added after. This is beyond the scope of the tutorial - once this README is completed (aka the stuff below is replaced with more useful steps), I'll consider the project completed!

Also consider adding music and SFX, as well as different colour modes, better button mapping etc.

TEST COMMIT TO MAKE SURE MY BRANCH PROTECTION IS ACTUALLY WORKING LOL

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
