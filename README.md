- Provided `useInterval` and `useSound` hooks

### Set-Up

1. Clone this repo to your own machine
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory of the repo
3. Run `npm install` in your directory via the terminal
4. After all dependencies are installed, run `npm start`
5. Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your favourite browser
